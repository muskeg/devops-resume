# devops-resume
As I've been getting more and more devops tasks I wish to get more serious with training and learnig.I decided to create a small pipeline demo to hold a Resume / CV / Portfolio of sorts (and who knows, maybe land a nice job with it).

This repo holds a Django app explaining it's a Django app. Pushing changes to this repo launches a Jenkins job building the app into containers and pushing it to a server for online consultation at https://muskegg.com
