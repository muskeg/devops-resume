# devops-resume
As I'm interested in getting more into DevOps work lately (and maybe find a new remote job?) I decided to create a small pipeline demo to hold a Resume / CV of sorts.

This repo holds an (language/framework to be determined) app. Pushing changes to this repo launches a Jenkins job building the app into containers and pushing it to a server for online consultation at https://muskegg.com
